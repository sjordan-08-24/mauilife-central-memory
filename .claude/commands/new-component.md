Create a new React component named "$ARGUMENTS".

File structure:
- Create folder: `web/src/components/$ARGUMENTS/`
- Component file: `web/src/components/$ARGUMENTS/$ARGUMENTS.jsx`
- Styles file: `web/src/components/$ARGUMENTS/$ARGUMENTS.css`

Requirements:
1. Create a functional React component
2. Include a corresponding CSS file for styling
3. Add helpful comments explaining what each part does
4. Keep it simple and beginner-friendly
5. If the component needs to fetch data, include an example using fetch
6. Export the component as default

After creating the component, show me how to import and use it in App.jsx.
