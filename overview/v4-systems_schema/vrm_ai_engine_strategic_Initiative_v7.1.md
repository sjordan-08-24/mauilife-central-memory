# Today

A talented team working hard across fragmented systems, constrained by knowledge gaps and communication bottlenecks from undocumented tribal knowledge and technology disconnects that prevent automation, AI use, and performance optimization.

**The result:** Increasing reliance on key individuals, halting performance and scalability, and heightened company vulnerability to change and disruptions.

**Recent Context:**
- 100% growth over the last 12 months
- Key internal team churn has exposed operational weak points in systems, training, and dependencies on founder
- Deep dive into building systems has exposed limitations within existing software

**Current Reality:**
- Property management system that doesn't talk to accounting
- Guest communications scattered across email, text, OTA messaging
- Homeowner updates require manual compilation
- Inspection checklists on paper or disconnected apps
- Vendor coordination through phone calls and memory
- Marketing efforts siloed from operational data
- No unified view of property performance
- Knowledge lives in people's heads, not systems

---

# Tomorrow

- All knowledge funnels real-time into a hierarchical, self-learning intelligence core
- Guaranteed service delivery from Property Care and Guest Experience teams empowered with real-time intelligence and "forget-proof" applications
- Accountability and reporting are fully autonomous, providing advanced intelligent analytics and consistent records
- Leadership has transparent visibility into all areas of the business
- Management Assistant leads prioritization of company resources to optimize growth and service delivery
- Leadership resources open to focus on vision, innovation, and relationships that grow the business
- Homeowners experience improved management tailored to their preferences with transparent access to all aspects of their property

**No bottlenecks. No forgotten details. No dependency on any person.**

The company runs intelligently whether leadership is on vacation, a key employee leaves, or we're scaling to 500 properties. And it all gets better over time because the system learns from every interaction.

# The Human + AI Model

The goal is optimal resource allocation—placing humans and AI in their strongest roles and tasks. AI agents amplify A-players' efforts and reward their contributions. The culture attracts more A-players while naturally filtering out B- and C-team members by valuing meaningful contributions.

| **Humans Excel At** | **AI Excels At** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Building trust and emotional connection | Remembering every preference and detail |
| Understanding human needs and preferences | Analyzing emotional cues from data points |
| Providing real-life knowledge of "what this should look like" | Responding instantly, 24/7/365 |
| Making judgment calls on exceptions | Following procedures perfectly every time |
| Guiding and auditing AI agent outputs | Processing thousands of data points |
| Quality craftsmanship on-site | Coordinating across all properties simultaneously |
| Relationship-building with owners and guests | Negotiating from perfect information |
| Delivering the human touch with AI-powered insight | Creative problem-solving from pattern recognition |

**Leadership's role:** Focus on homeowner relationships, strategic growth, and high-value decisions. Let the AI handle the volume.

**Team's role:** Focus on the human moments—the guest who needs extra care, the property that needs creative problem-solving, the vendor relationship that needs a personal touch. Empowered by real-time intelligence and complete data, the team delivers exceptional service while AI handles the repetitive coordination.

## System 1: Central Memory
### The Data Foundation

Central Memory is the unified intelligence layer—the single source of truth that connects every property, every guest, every homeowner, every reservation, every ticket, every document, and every piece of operational knowledge. It's the foundation that makes everything else possible.

### The Database

Central Memory is a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, designed with enterprise-grade architecture to scale from 45 to 500+ properties without architectural changes.

**Schema Architecture:**

| Schema | Tables | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **ops.*** | 55 | Core operations: properties, reservations, guests, homeowners, contacts, tickets |
| **ref.*** | 15 | Reference data: statuses, categories, SLAs, property types |
| **geo.*** | 5 | Geographic data: zones, cities, areas, resort locations |
| **ai.*** | 8 | AI infrastructure: agent configs, conversation logs, guardrails |
| **comms.*** | 6 | Communications: threads, messages, templates, channels |
| **knowledge.*** | 15 | Master library, documents, SOPs, vector embeddings |
| **observability.*** | 5 | System health: ETL logs, data quality issues, alerts |
| **pricing.*** | 6 | Revenue: rates, competitors, market events, adjustments |
| **portal.*** | 6 | User access: sessions, preferences, permissions |
| **concierge.*** | 24 | Guest experience: locations, itineraries, activities, add-ons |
| **finance.*** | 12 | Accounting: trust ledger, statements, invoices, payables |
| **listing.*** | 8 | Listings: content, photos, performance metrics |
| **brand.*** | 15 | Branding: identity, social accounts, content library |
| **marketing.*** | 12 | Campaigns: emails, segments, attribution, analytics |
| **acquisition.*** | 10 | Growth: prospects, outreach, pipeline, onboarding |

**Total: 187+ tables across 15 schemas**

**Business ID Methodology:**

Every entity has a human-readable business ID that serves as the primary key:

| Entity | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Property | `prop.{company}.{id}` | `prop.mlvr.10045` |
| Reservation | `res.{company}.{id}` | `res.mlvr.25001` |
| Guest | `gst.{id}` | `gst.30042` |
| Homeowner | `own.{id}` | `own.10015` |
| Contact | `con.{type}.{id}` | `con.vnd.10089` |
| Ticket | `tkt.{type}.{id}` | `tkt.mnt.40521` |

### Strategic Relationship Management

The core of Central Memory is a comprehensive contact system that tracks relationships across every entity type. Every contact—homeowner, guest, vendor, team member—has a complete profile that powers personalized interactions.

**AI Personality Intelligence:**

Every contact profile includes AI-analyzed personality data:

- **Communication Style:** Formal vs. casual, detail-oriented vs. high-level, prefers phone vs. email vs. text
- **Response Patterns:** When they typically respond, how quickly, what triggers engagement
- **Sentiment Trends:** Are they getting happier or more frustrated over time?
- **Predictive Insights:** Likely to churn? Ready for upsell? Needs attention?
- **Relationship History:** Every interaction, decision, preference expressed

This intelligence enables personalized communication at scale—every homeowner, guest, and vendor receives communication tailored to their preferences automatically.

### Master Library & Document Storage

Central Memory includes a comprehensive document management system organized by department and section. Every operational document—SOPs, contracts, guides, templates—lives in one searchable, version-controlled repository.

**10 Departments:**

| ID | Department | Example Sections |
|----|------------|------------------|
| 01 | Executive & Administrative | Vision, Strategy, Compliance, Legal, Security |
| 02 | Marketing & Sales | Branding, Content, OTA Strategy, Lead Generation |
| 03 | Reservations & Guest Services | Guest Journey, Arrivals, Communication, Reviews |
| 04 | Homeowner Services | Onboarding, Portal, Reporting, Preferences |
| 05 | Property Care | Inspections, Cleaning, Maintenance, Inventory |
| 06 | Finance & Accounting | Payouts, Reconciliation, Tax, Budgeting |
| 07 | Revenue Management | Pricing, Market Research, Forecasting |
| 08 | HR & Vendor Management | Hiring, Training, Contractors, Performance |
| 09 | Office Management | Supplies, Reception, Workspace |
| 10 | Technology & AI | Software, APIs, Integrations, Automation |

**Document Types:**

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| **Operational** | SOPs, Guides, Playbooks, Checklists, Pro-Tips, Tutorials, Templates |
| **Communication** | Memos, Announcements, Notices, Newsletters |
| **Meetings** | Meeting Summaries, Transcripts, Call Summaries, Call Transcripts |
| **Strategy** | Executive Summaries, Decision Logs, Strategic Roadmaps |
| **Property** | Inspections, Listings, Marketing Assets, HOA Documents |
| **Legal** | Management Contracts, Insurance Binders, Agreements |
| **Financial** | Invoices, Work Orders, Statements, Analytics |

**Master Library Asset Types:**

| Type | Code | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| SOP Library | SOP | Step-by-step standard operating procedures |
| Playbooks | PLY | Strategic documents combining SOPs and best practices |
| Guides | GDE | How-to and reference documents |

| Checklists | CHK | Process checklists |
| Diagrams | DIA | Visual process charts and flowcharts |
| Master Sheets | MSHT | Centralized configuration and standards |
| Trigger Links | TRG | Documents linked to business action triggers |

**Time-Sensitive Document Intelligence:**

Documents have temporal relevance that the system tracks:
- Construction schedules expire after their end date
- HOA notices trigger alerts during relevant windows
- Maintenance schedules auto-trigger recurring tasks
- Policy updates supersede previous versions
- Most recent information always takes priority
- Conflicting information flagged for human review

**Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search:**

- Search by describing a situation, get relevant procedures
- Personality profiles embedded for communication matching
- Automatic relevant document surfacing based on context
- Real-time knowledge retrieval powers every interaction

### Market Analytics

Central Memory tracks comprehensive market data:

- **Competitor Intelligence:** Rates, availability, listing changes across the market
- **Demand Patterns:** Booking pace, lead time, seasonal trends

## System 2: AI Ops Command Center
### Track, Optimize, Execute

The AI Ops Command Center is the operational brain—tracking what the team is doing, where time and resources are spent, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. It provides real-time insight into operational costs by property, enabling data-driven decisions about which properties are profitable to manage.

### The Team Hub Application

The Team Hub is where every team member starts their day. It replaces scattered task lists, Slack searches, and "where do I find..." questions with a single, intelligent command center.

**Smart Task Queue**

All work flows into one prioritized queue:
- Tasks auto-assigned based on skills, location, and workload
- Priority calculated from SLA deadlines, guest impact, and urgency
- Real-time rebalancing when priorities change
- Clear visibility into what's next and what's waiting

**Task Queue Features:**
- Filter by property, task type, priority, or assignee
- Bulk actions for similar tasks
- Quick-complete for routine items
- Escalation triggers for overdue items
- Notes and photo attachment on any task

**Route Optimization**

For field team members, the day's tasks are organized by optimal driving route:
- Minimizes drive time between properties
- Accounts for task duration estimates
- Real-time rerouting when priorities change
- Integration with maps for navigation
- Estimated completion time for the full day

- Routine notifications batched
- Customizable notification preferences
- Do-not-disturb modes for focused work
- Escalation paths when items need attention

**Seamless Chat Interface**

Natural language access to everything:

### The Ticketing System

Every issue tracked, every resolution documented, nothing slips through. The ticketing system is the operational backbone that ensures accountability and visibility across every property issue.

**Ticket Creation:**

Tickets are created through multiple channels:
- **Automatic:** AI scans all communications (email, Slack, calls, texts) and creates tickets for detected issues
- **Inspection:** Issues found during property inspections auto-generate tickets
- **Manual:** Team members create tickets directly when needed
- **Guest App:** Guest-reported issues create tickets automatically
- **Homeowner App:** Owner-reported concerns create tickets

**Ticket Categories:**

| Category | Examples | Default SLA |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Maintenance** | Repairs, replacements, fixes | 24-48 hours |
| **Housekeeping** | Cleaning issues, restocking | 4-8 hours |
| **Guest Issue** | Complaints, requests, problems | 2-4 hours |
| **Inventory** | Missing items, reorders | 24 hours |
| **Vendor** | Coordination, scheduling | 48 hours |
| **Owner Request** | Homeowner asks, concerns | 24 hours |
| **Inspection** | Follow-ups from inspections | Varies |

**Ticket Intelligence:**

Every ticket includes rich context:
- **Property History:** Previous tickets for this property, patterns
- **Asset Information:** If about an appliance, full specs, warranty, parts info
- **Guest Context:** Who's staying, when they arrive/depart, VIP status
- **Owner Preferences:** How owner wants to be notified, approval thresholds
- **Related Tickets:** Similar issues at other properties, vendor performance

**Ticket Workflow:**

**Pattern Detection:**

The ticketing system identifies patterns across properties:
- Recurring issues at the same property
- Common problems with specific appliance models
- Vendor performance (completion time, quality, callbacks)
- Seasonal trends (what breaks more in summer vs. winter)
- Predictive maintenance opportunities

### Property Profitability Dashboard

The Command Center provides insight into which properties are profitable to manage.

## System 3: Property Quality Assurance
### Know Everything Inside Every Property

Property Quality Assurance maintains detailed knowledge of everything inside every property. When a ticket mentions a dishwasher, the system knows exactly what model is installed, when it was purchased, what parts it needs, and which vendor services it. This powers intelligent inspections, proactive maintenance, and seamless vendor coordination.

### The Property Asset Database

Central Memory contains comprehensive tables tracking every physical asset:

**Property Structure:**

| Table | What's Tracked |
|-------|----------------|
| **Rooms** | Every room in every property—name, type, dimensions, features, reference photos |

| **Furniture** | Every piece—sofas, tables, chairs, dressers, with brand, age, condition |
| **Window Coverings** | Blinds, curtains, shades—type, brand, motorized/manual, dimensions |
| **Lighting** | Every fixture—type, bulb requirements, smart controls, dimmer capability |

**Appliances:**

| **Doors & Locks** | Entry, interior, closet—type, smart lock model, access code management |

**Inventory:**

| Table | What's Tracked |

| **Consumables** | Toiletries, cleaning supplies, coffee, etc.—par levels, reorder triggers |

### The Inspection Application

The Inspection App transforms property inspections from tedious checklists into intelligent, guided experiences that capture everything and ensure nothing is missed.

**Inspection Types:**

| **Mid-Stay** | Long stays, VIP guests | Proactive quality check, restock | 10-15 min |
| **Maintenance** | Ticket follow-up | Issue-specific investigation | Varies |
| **Quarterly Deep** | Every 90 days | Full asset audit, condition assessment | 60-90 min |
| **Post-Deep-Clean** | After deep clean | Verify cleaning quality | 20-30 min |

- "The throw pillow arrangement doesn't match baseline—verify placement"

**Automatic Issue Detection:**
- AI identifies potential problems in photos
- Stains, damage, missing items flagged automatically
- Tickets created for detected issues
- Severity assessment helps prioritization

**Real-Time Feedback:**

### The Guest Journey

The guest relationship follows a carefully designed journey from booking through rebooking:

**Phase 1: Booking Confirmed**

When a guest books—whether 2 weeks or 12 months out:
- Welcome message sent immediately
- Property details and what to expect
- Pre-arrival questionnaire link
- We begin learning about their trip

**Phase 2: Learning Phase**

Between booking and arrival, we gather information:
- Who's traveling (adults, children, ages)
- Purpose of trip (anniversary, family reunion, honeymoon)
- Interests (adventure, relaxation, food, culture)
- Dietary restrictions or allergies
- Special occasions during stay
- Activity level preferences
- Previous Maui experience

This happens through friendly conversation, not interrogation.

**Phase 3: Pre-Arrival (14 Days Out)**

Two weeks before arrival:
- Detailed property information
- Packing suggestions for the season
- Draft personalized itinerary
- Add-on service offers (as helpful suggestions, not sales)
- What to do on arrival day

**Phase 4: Arrival Week**

The week of arrival:
- Final itinerary with all reservations
- Check-in instructions
- Property access details
- Emergency contacts
- Local insider tips

**Phase 5: Check-In Day**

On arrival day:
- Access code delivered at check-in time
- Welcome message
- Real-time support for any issues
- First-day recommendations

**Phase 6: During Stay**

Throughout the stay:
- Daily recommendations based on weather and interests
- Available for any questions or issues
- Activity and dining suggestions
- Mid-stay check-in for longer stays
- Proactive problem prevention

**Phase 7: Departure**

At checkout:
- Thank you and safe travels
- Lost and found check
- Review request (timed for optimal response)
- Invitation to stay in touch

**Phase 8: Forever Nurture**

After departure, the relationship continues:
- 7 days: "Hope you made it home safely!"
- 30 days: "Missing Maui?" with rebooking offer
- Anniversary: "One year ago you stayed with us..."
- Birthdays: Personalized message
- Seasonal: "Planning your next escape?"
- Relevant content: Articles, events, updates about Maui

### Concierge Philosophy

> "We don't sell add-ons. We serve guests by making their stay better. The beach gear isn't a revenue line—it's convenience. The grocery pre-stock isn't an upsell—it's arriving to a stocked fridge instead of running to the store. Every recommendation is a gift, not a pitch."

The concierge system provides genuine value:
- Recommendations based on actual preferences, not margins
- Honest opinions about restaurants and activities
- Local insider knowledge that tourists can't find online
- Proactive suggestions that anticipate needs
- Seamless booking without feeling sold to

### Add-On Services

### Guest Communication

## System 8: Property Branding & Social
### Every Property Is a Brand

Property Branding & Social creates unique brand identities for each property. Rather than generic vacation rentals, each property becomes its own brand with personality, following, and content. This creates marketing assets and competitive differentiation.

### The Branding Philosophy

> "Do you want your property managed... or branded?"
>
> "When we build Hale Kai's Instagram to 12,000 followers, that's OUR followers. OUR brand. OUR asset. If the homeowner leaves, they lose the brand. This is leverage."

Each property gets:
- Unique brand identity
- Dedicated social media presence
- Content strategy
- Visual standards
- Voice and personality

### Brand Creation

For each property, we develop:

**Brand Identity:**
- Property name (if not already established)
- Logo and visual mark
- Color palette
- Typography
- Photography style

**Brand Voice:**
- Personality traits (luxurious, casual, family-friendly, romantic)
- Tone of voice
- Key messaging themes
- Hashtag strategy

**Signature Elements:**
- Welcome ritual (what guests experience on arrival)
- Scent profile (if applicable)
- Music/ambiance
- Special touches unique to property

**Brand Standards:**
- How the property is photographed
- How it's described in listings
- Social media guidelines
- Guest communication tone

### Social Media Management

Each property maintains active social profiles:

**Platforms:**
- Instagram (primary)
- Facebook
- Pinterest (for aspirational content)
- TikTok (for applicable properties)

**Content Strategy:**

| **Maui Life** | Daily | Sunsets, beaches, culture |
| **Stories** | Daily | Real-time content, engagement |

**Automated Content Generation:**

The system generates content automatically:
